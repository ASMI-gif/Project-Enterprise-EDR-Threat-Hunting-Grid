 # Enterprise EDR & Threat Hunting Grid 

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment, configuration, and validation of a Wazuh-based SIEM environment.  
The objective is to simulate a real-world SOC setup including infrastructure deployment, endpoint monitoring, and custom detection logic.

The project is divided into two phases:
- Week 1: Infrastructure & Agent Deployment
- Week 2: Detection Rules & Alert Validation
- Week 3: Active Response (IPS)
- Week 4: Threat Simulation

---

## Architecture Overview
- Wazuh Manager deployed on a dedicated Linux server
- Windows Server with Wazuh Agent + Sysmon
- Linux Web Server with Wazuh Agent
- Centralized monitoring via Wazuh Dashboard
